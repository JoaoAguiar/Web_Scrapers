# BOTS

Some of these bots most probably don't work now, because the structure of some of these websites have changed, so some of the web calls may not work

## Twitter
The idea of this bot is to go to Twitter and look for a keyword. After doing the keyword/hashtag search, it sees post by post and likes it with a 50% probability.

This bot only scrolls the page 3 times, which can be changed in the code.

## Instagram
This bot enters Instagram and goes to the user's profile where it then compares the people that this user follows and who follows him. In the end he puts in a text file the people he follows but who do not follow him.

## Reddit Communities
RedditBot will enter the reddit communities leaderboard page and write all the communities it finds in a text file.

This bot only scrolls the page 4 times, which can be changed in the code.

## Reddit News
This bot uses the Reddit API to check the first 100 posts of a subreddit, and then saves the ones that have a certain keyword. After that, send the saved posts to the mail

## LinkdIn Jobs
This bot, goes to LinkedIn and does a job search, and the user chooses the position, competence or company, the city, state or postal code and the number of scrolls he makes on the page. It saves the company name, job position and city in a text file.
